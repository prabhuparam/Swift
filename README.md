# Swift-Doc

This document is for anyone who aspires to learn Swift in a couple of days or for swift developers for all-time quick reference.

The document gives a brief overview in points from the book “The Swift 2.2 Programming Language” by Apple. You can download the iBook from "https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11". 

The structure in this document reflects the same structure followed by Apple in the iBook.

The Swift version that is documented is 2.2. This document will be updated as and when Apple rolls out new versions of Swift.
