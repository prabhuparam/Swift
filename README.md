# Swift-Doc

Welcome Developers!

This document is for anyone who aspires to learn Swift in a couple of days or for iOS developers as an all-time quick reference document.

The document gives a brief overview of Swift 2.2. You can download the iBook from "https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11". 

You must be wondering what would be the difference between the Appleâ€™s Swift 2.2 book and this document. In this document I have jotted down take-home points from the book and organised the sections into points for easy reading and quick reference.

The structure in this document reflects the same structure followed by Apple in the iBook. You are free to refer to the document you are comfortable with.

The Swift version that is documented is 2.2. I will update the document as and when Apple rolls out new versions of Swift.
